# Machine Translation
The repo targets creating simple one-to-one machine translation models, clearing the basics

## Steps to run nodejs demo
    - cd `node-demo`
    - run `npm i`
    - run `node translate.js`

That's it.


## Steps to run python demo
    - `pip install onnxruntime tokenizers unidecode numpy`
    - `python translate.py`

That's it for python, too.

Now, you can enjoy runing the demo on your machine
